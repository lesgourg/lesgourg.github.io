<h1>
Monte Carlo Markov Chains for mock Planck data (with and without
lensing extraction)
</h1>

We provide here the chains from the paper <font color=white>"Probing cosmological
parameters with the CMB: Forecasts from full Monte Carlo simulations"</font>
by Laurence Perotto, Julien Lesgourgues, Steen Hannestad, Huitzu Tu,
Yvonne Y.Y. Wong, JCAP 0610 (2006) 013 [<a href="http://fr.arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0606227" target="blank">astro-ph/0606227</a>]. These
chains could be useful for people willing to estimate future
errors for a combination of Planck data with another mock data set: it is
then possible to perform some importance sampling analysis starting
from our chains.
<p>
These chains cover four situations: eight or eleven free cosmological
parameters, each with or without lensing extraction.
<p>
The model with eight free parameters is the minimal model to consider
in a Planck analysis: its parameters are the six parameters of the
"vanilla model" considered by e.g. WMAP, plus the primordial helium
fraction (should not be kept fixed at the level of precision of
Planck) and the fraction of dark matter in the form of massive
neutrinos (cannot be neglected for Planck, given lower bounds on the
neutrino mass from neutrino oscillation experiments). The model with
eleven parameters is an extended model with extra parameters alpha (running of the scalar
tilt), r (tensor-to-scalar ratio), and w (Dark Energy pressure over density).
<p>
In the chains where lensing extraction is included, it was assumed
that the deflection spectrum dd and the cross-spectrum Td are being
measured using the quadratic estimator technique of Hu and
Okamoto. These spectra are then fitted together with the TT/TE/EE
spectra, including an estimate of the noise for the dd spectrum which
is derived from Hu and Okamoto's analytic formulas.
<p>
Moreover, in each case, the parameter reconstruction can be performed
by fitting directly the theoretical spectra instead of some random
realization. In that case, the best-fit parameter values coincide with
the fiducial values and the minimum log likelihood is zero; despite
these unrealistic features, this approach is sufficient for estimating
the error bar on each parameter. So, in each case, we provide chains
fitted directly to the fiducial model spectrum. In the case of eight
parameters / no lensing extraction, we also provide chains fitting
five different random realizations of the fiducial model. 
<p>
Name of the chain roots:
<ul>
<li><font color=white>Model_nolens_8p</font>: eight parameters, no lensing extraction, fiducial spectra
<li><font color=white>Seed1_nolens_8p</font>: eight parameters, no lensing extraction, random realization of same model
<li><font color=white>Seed2_nolens_8p</font>: eight parameters, no lensing extraction, random realization of same model
<li><font color=white>Seed3_nolens_8p</font>: eight parameters, no lensing extraction, random realization of same model
<li><font color=white>Seed4_nolens_8p</font>: eight parameters, no lensing extraction, random realization of same model
<li><font color=white>Seed5_nolens_8p</font>: eight parameters, no lensing extraction, random realization of same model
<li><font color=white>Model_lens_8p</font>: eight parameters, with lensing extraction, fiducial spectra
<li><font color=white>Model_nolens_11p</font>: eleven parameters, no lensing extraction, fiducial spectra
<li><font color=white>Model_lens_11p</font>: eleven parameters, with lensing extraction, fiducial spectra
</ul>
<p>
The file <a href="chains.tar.gz">chains.tar</a> contains all these chains (30 chains in each case). They are raw chains,
the burn-in phase still needs to be remove.
