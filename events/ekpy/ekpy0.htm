<LI>If you have time...
</H2>
...why don't you arrive earlier and spend the week-end in Annecy? It is
one of the most lovely towns in the french Alps, with its many canals,
medieval houses, good restaurants... And if the snow conditions are
good, you may have a chance to start your skiing season at 
<a href="http://www.laclusaz.com/">La Clusaz or Le Grand Bornand</a>,
which are only 30 minutes away by car (or one hour by coach).
The organizers are ready to provide any practical or touristic information
for having a pleasant time before or after the conference.
