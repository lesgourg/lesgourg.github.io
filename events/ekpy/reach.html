<H2> Reaching LAPTH by car from Geneva </H2>

When arriving nearby Annecy by the main road N 201, or from the exit
Annecy Nord on the highway, the trick is to follow always the
direction <b>THONES</b> rather than Annecy-Le-Vieux. This is really important
and should take all your attention.
<p>
After many
intersections and roundabouts, you will be directed to a new express
road, which seems to leave completely the town in the direction of the
mountains. Go on anyway! The express road ends up on a
roundabout. Take the second way out, called <b>Sur les Bois</b>, and
then the third small road on your left, called <b>Chemin de
Bellevue</b>, with an indication for <b>LAPP</b>
and <b>Domaine
Universitaire</b>. After 200 meters, you will
find on your right the entrance and car park of LAPP and LAPTH.
<p>
If you get lost, you may follow the indications for the <b>Domaine
Universitaire (IUT)</b> or for the <b>H&ocirc;tel Arc-en-ciel</b>
in Annecy-Le-Vieux.
It will bring you 100 meters downhill from LAPP.

When arriving from Paris and M&acirc;con on the motorway A40,
take the exit "St Eloise", just after Bellegarde, and follow the
indications for Annecy.
<p>
After 20 kilometers, when you see on your left a big commercial center
(Auchan, ...), stop following Annecy or Annecy-le-Vieux,
and concentrate only on the indications for 
<b>THONES</b>. This is really important.

<H2> Reaching LAPTH by train until Annecy</H2>

The <a href="http://www.sncf.fr">SNCF</a> provides good train connections
with Paris, Lyon, Chambery. There
are several direct TGVs Paris-Annecy everyday. On the other hand, the
connection with Geneva is extremely bad.
<p>
When arriving at the station, cross the square and take on your left the
"Rue Vaugelas". You will find the bus stop for bus number 4. Take this
bus until the terminus called "IUT". You still have to walk for a couple of
minutes, following the indications for LAPP. The LAPP and LAPTH are located
in the same building, up the "Chemin de Bellevue".
